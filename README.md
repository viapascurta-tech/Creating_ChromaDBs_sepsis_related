# Creating_ChromaDBs_sepsis_related
This repository describes how to create sepsis-related vector stores, which can be used as a tool for retrieval-augmented generation within the Multiagent Approach.
Created embedding databases are based on the [Chromadb platform](https://www.trychroma.com/). The embedding model is *BAAB-1.5-small* and the similarity function is represented by *cosine*.
